# UnityRaymarch
Project for Agrat

This is a uni project proof of concept for ray-marching.

Scene 1 is entirely GPU calcualted physics and rendering. Player Can move a red ball and collide with other balls.
Scene 2 is a showcase of a potential modeling pipeline. Using player input to create a face on a sphere. (Very basic)
Scene 3 is a showcase of fidelity in raymarching. Scaling an object from the width of a needle to 100,000 + meters in diameter (before breaking)
Scene 4 is another showcase of potential modeling, only randomly generated with multiple different shapes. (The results are... Random)
